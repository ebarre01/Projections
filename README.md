# Map projections: From a 3D object to a 2D representation 

## Class objectives: 
* Understand projections and key steps in the projection process 
* Examine how different projection choices influence: 
    1) standard point or line(s)
    2) patterns of deformation using the four key projection properties (e.g., shape, area, distance, direction)
* Explore global scale projections 

## Class slides:

## Class activity instructions: 

In small groups, explore your assigned world projection. Answer the guiding questions and be prepared to share out with the class. 

World projections: 
* Mercator
* Hammer 
* Mollweide 
* Gall-Peters 
* Winkel Tripel 
* Goodeâ€™s Homolosine 
* Or choose your own

Activity resources: You can use your textbook and explore the projections with a visualization tool [linked here](https://observablehq.com/@floledermann/projection-playground) and informational tool [linked here](https://map-projections.net/singleview.php)

Guiding questions: 
1) Describe the most noticeable distortions you see on this map. How are shape, area, direction and distance affected? 
2) What kinds of stories or information would this map projection be most effective at communicating? Think about the types of data or topics where its distortions might not matter (or might even be helpful).
3) What kinds of stories or information would this map projection be least effective at communicating? What misunderstandings or misinterpretations could arise from using this map for certain purposes?
4) Can you think of a real-world example where using this projection might be problematic or misleading? Why?
