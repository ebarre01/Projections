# Map projections: From a 3D object to a 2D representation 

## Class objectives: 
* Understand projections and key steps in the projection process 
* Examine how different projection choices influence: 
    1) standard point or line(s)
    2) patterns of deformation using the four key projection properties (e.g., shape, area, distance, direction)
* Explore global scale projections 

## Class slides: 

Slides for the class can be found [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGdg_oCxs8/dE5sQG5Z1y-ZKctVgO9qwA/view?utm_content=DAGdg_oCxs8&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=uniquelinks&utlId=h05c43d3aa5
).

Key terms: 
* Projections 
* Developable surfaces 
* Aspects 
* Cases 
* Standard point / line(s) 
* Tissot's indicatrix
* Projection properties (e.g. shape, area, distance, direction)
* Equal area projection 
* Conformal projection 
* Equidistant projection 
* Azimuthal projection 

## Class activity instructions: 

In small groups, explore your assigned world projection. Answer the guiding questions and be prepared to share out with the class. 

World projections: 
* Mercator 
* Mollweide (?) 
* Hammer projection (?)
* Sanson-Falmsteed (?)
* Gall-Peters (?)
* Boone 
* Robinson 
* Winkel triple 
* Choose your own 

Activity resources: You can use your textbook and explore the projections with a visualization tool [linked here](https://observablehq.com/@floledermann/projection-playground)

Guiding questions: 
1) Describe the projection's mechanics (e.g. developable surface, case, aspect, standard line(s)) 
2) Describe the deformation pattern using the four key projection properties (e.g. area, shape, distance, direction)
3) Describe potential map purposes that make this projection more useful
4) Describe potential map purposes that make this projection less useful 
5) Describe any challenges to using this map projection
